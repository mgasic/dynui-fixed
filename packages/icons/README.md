# @dynui/icons

This workspace provides a typed registry for the first set of DynUI icons.
During Phaseâ€¯1 we only ship a handful of inline SVG paths so components can be
wired to the eventual asset pipeline.  Future iterations will replace these
placeholders with generated sprites or React components sourced from the design
team.
