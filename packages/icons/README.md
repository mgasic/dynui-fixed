# @dynui/icons

The icon package will eventually host the SVG source files, conversion
pipeline, and React bindings that power DynUI. The current implementation
exposes a placeholder registry so consumers can verify the dependency is
wired correctly without shipping real assets yet.

Add new icons by registering them in `src/index.ts` or by introducing a
generator in a future phase.
