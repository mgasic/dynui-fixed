# @dynui/eslint-config

Provides the baseline ESLint configuration for DynUI packages and apps.
Consumers can import the `baseEslintConfig` object or use the
`withOverrides` helper to merge in project-specific tweaks.

Extend this module with additional presets (Storybook, Vitest, etc.) as
the workspace grows.
