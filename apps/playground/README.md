# DynUI Playground

A lightweight Vite + React application for trying DynUI components in a
sandboxed environment. Run `pnpm --filter @dynui/playground dev` from the
repo root to start the development server.

As additional packages are introduced, import them inside `src/App.tsx`
or create dedicated routes/modules to exercise complex scenarios.
