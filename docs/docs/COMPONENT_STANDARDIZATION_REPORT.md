## 🎯 Architecture Patterns Established

### File Structure Standard

```
DynComponent/
├── DynComponent.tsx          # Main component
├── DynComponent.types.ts     # TypeScript interfaces
├── DynComponent.module.css   # CSS with design tokens
├── DynComponent.test.tsx     # Vitest tests
├── DynComponent.stories.tsx  # Storybook documentation
└── index.ts                  # Standardized exports
```

### TypeScript Pattern

```typescript
// Extend base interfaces
export interface DynComponentProps
  extends BaseComponentProps,
    AccessibilityProps {
  // Component-specific props
}

// forwardRef with proper typing
export const DynComponent = forwardRef<HTMLElement, DynComponentProps>(
  (props, ref) => {
    // Implementation
  },
);
```

### CSS Token Pattern

```css
.component {
  background: var(--dyn-color-surface, var(--color-surface, #ffffff));
  padding: var(--dyn-spacing-md, var(--spacing-md, 0.75rem));
  border-radius: var(--dyn-border-radius-md, var(--border-radius-md, 0.5rem));
}
```

### Quality Gates (CI automation)

| Gate | Focus                                          | CI Command        |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| A    | Static analysis (ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier) | `pnpm run gate:a` |
| B    | Unit, interaction and E2E regression tests     | `pnpm run gate:b` |
| C    | Accessibility (axe audit)                      | `pnpm run gate:c` |
| D    | Visual regression (Playwright snapshots)       | `pnpm run gate:d` |
| E    | API surface validation (tsd snapshot)          | `pnpm run gate:e` |
| F    | Bundle size budgets & analyzer                 | `pnpm run gate:f` |

**Gate A — Static analysis**

- `pnpm run test:interaction` (Storybook test runner against `autotest` smoke stories)
- `pnpm run test:e2e` (Playwright, demo app)

**Gate C — Accessibility**

- `pnpm run test:axe` (Playwright + axe-core scan)

**Gate D — Visual regression**

**Gate E — API contract**

- `pnpm run test:api` (tsd snapshot of public surface)

**Gate F — Bundle performance**

- `pnpm run bundle:check` (Rollup visualizer + gzip/brotli budgets on DynButton smoke bundle)
